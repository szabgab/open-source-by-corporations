# Open Source by corporations

There are a lot of corporations that share some of the software they created for themselves under an Open Source license.
It is very interesting to see and also an opportunity to increase your chances of employment. Make yourself familiar with their
code, open some issues, send some pull-requests. If you are lucky they might notice you and offer you a job. Even if that does
not happen you can include your contribution in your CV and you can mention it during the ineterview.
